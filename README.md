# Datasets
In our experiments, two of the most commonly used HSI datasets are adopted, namely, Pavia University and Salinas. The Pavia University and Salinas datasets can be collected from https://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes.

# Requirements
python 3.9, Tensorflow 2.10.0, Spyder IDE

# Results
To quantitatively measure the proposed model, three evaluation metrics are employed to verify the effectiveness of the algorithm, including Overall Accuracy (OA), Average Accuracy (AA) and Cohen's Kappa (k).
